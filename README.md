# OpenSCAD-Enclosure
A script for the OpenSCAD software package, that creates boxed for electronic projects like this:
<mg src=https://github.com/astromikemerri/OpenSCAD-Enclosure/blob/main/SampleBox.JPG width=400>

As well as being able to specify the interior diimensions of the box and other parameters like the wall thickness, the user can also specify rectangular and circular apertures in any of the walls of the box.

To get it to work, <A href=https://openscad.org/downloads.html>Install OpenSCAD</a>, edit <a href=https://github.com/astromikemerri/OpenSCAD-Enclosure/blob/main/Enclosure.scad>the script</a> to specify the size you want and the apertures you require</a>, open the file in OpenSCAD, preview it (F5 key) and when it looks the way you want, render it (F6 key). You can then export it (File>Export) as <A href=https://github.com/astromikemerri/OpenSCAD-Enclosure/blob/main/Enclosure.stl>>an STL file</a>, or whatever other format your 3D printer supports.
